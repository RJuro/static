    <h1>Terms of Service for PDF Digester</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: October 26, 2023</p> <!-- UPDATE THIS DATE -->

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the PDF Digester service ("Service") offered through our website at https://nerdlm.rjuro.com ("Website"). By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms and our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a>. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Service.</p>
    <p>The Service is operated in Denmark and these Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Denmark, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> You must be at least 18 years old or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction to use the Service. By using the Service, you represent and warrant that you meet this requirement.</p>
    <p><strong>Permitted Use:</strong> The Service is intended primarily for personal academic and research purposes. Internal business use is permitted <em>only</em> when directly related to academic or research functions (e.g., internal R&D literature analysis, competitive intelligence research). Use for critical business decision-making is discouraged due to the nature of AI-generated content (see Section 5).</p>
    <p><strong>Restrictions:</strong> You agree not to use the Service for any illegal, unauthorized, or prohibited purpose. This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Uploading content that infringes upon the intellectual property rights of others.</li>
        <li>Attempting to gain unauthorized access to the Service or its related systems.</li>
        <li>Using the Service to transmit spam, viruses, or other harmful code.</li>
        <li>Violating any applicable local, national, or international laws or regulations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Compliance:</strong> You agree to comply with these Terms and all applicable laws and regulations when using the Service.</p>

    <h2>3. User Content and Responsibility</h2>
    <p>You are solely responsible for any documents, data, or information ("Content") you upload or submit to the Service. By uploading Content, you represent and warrant that:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>You own the Content or have all necessary rights, licenses, consents, and permissions to upload and allow us (and our third-party processors) to process the Content as described in these Terms.</li>
        <li>Your Content does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights, or any other rights of any person or entity.</li>
        <li>You grant us a limited, non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, process, display, and distribute your Content solely for the purpose of providing, maintaining, and improving the Service to you. This license terminates when your Content is deleted from our systems as described in Section 8.</li>
        <li>You understand that we will not share your Content with any third party unless you actively choose to share it or as required for processing by our necessary third-party service providers (see Section 4) or by law.</li>
        <li>You acknowledge our commitment: <strong>We will not use your uploaded Content to train our own or third-party general-purpose AI models.</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>We respect your intellectual property rights and expect you to do the same.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Data Processing</h2>
    <p>Our Service utilizes third-party services to function, including Google Gemini and potentially other AI services for content analysis, and RunPod's infrastructure hosting the Kokoro text-to-speech (TTS) model for audio generation. By using our Service, you acknowledge and agree that:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Your uploaded Content (original PDFs) will be transmitted to and processed by these necessary third-party services to enable the core functionality (analysis, summarization).</li>
        <li>Text derived from your Content or generated by the Service for audio output will be processed by our RunPod-hosted TTS service.</li>
        <li>The processing of your Content by these third parties is subject to their respective privacy policies and terms of service. We encourage you to review the policies of Google Cloud AI and RunPod.</li>
        <li>While we select providers who contractually commit to certain data handling standards (including commitments regarding not using customer data for general model training without consent) and implement reasonable safeguards, we cannot exercise direct control over their internal processes. Our liability regarding third-party processing is limited as described in Section 11.</li>
        <li>We take reasonable measures to ensure that third-party processing is limited to what is necessary to provide our Service features. For text-to-speech generation, the text is processed temporarily by the TTS service and is not permanently stored by that specific service after audio generation is complete.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>5. Accuracy of Generated Content</h2>
    <p>The Service uses advanced AI technology. While we strive for high-quality and accurate summaries, reviews, classifications, references, and audio content, the outputs are generated automatically and may contain errors, omissions, inaccuracies, or reflect biases present in the AI models or the source material. <strong>We do not guarantee the perfect accuracy, completeness, or suitability of any generated content.</strong> You should critically evaluate and independently verify all generated information before relying on it for academic submissions, publications, or any critical decisions.</p>

    <h2>6. Service Limitations and Availability</h2>
    <p><strong>Free Usage:</strong> As a free service (currently), usage may be subject to limitations (e.g., number of documents processed per day, feature availability). Details about current limits, if any, will be communicated on the Website.</p>
    <p><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> We reserve the right to introduce paid subscription plans for advanced features or increased usage limits in the future.</p>
    <p><strong>Modifications:</strong> We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Service (or any part or content thereof) at any time with or without notice.</p>
    <p><strong>Availability:</strong> The Service is provided "as is" and "as available." We do not guarantee that the Service will always be secure, uninterrupted, error-free, or available.</p>

    <h2>7. Confidentiality</h2>
    <p>We treat your uploaded Content as confidential information, subject to the processing needs described in these Terms (especially Sections 3, 4, and 8). We implement reasonable administrative, physical, and technical security measures designed to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the generated content stored by our Service. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>We prioritize your data privacy and efficient resource management.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Original Uploaded Files:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> permanently store the original PDF files you upload to the Service on our servers. These files are processed transiently (temporarily held for analysis and processing) and sent to third-party AI services (like Google Gemini) as required to provide the Service (see Section 4). The handling and retention of your original uploaded Content by these third parties are subject to their respective terms and privacy policies. Once processing relevant to your session is complete, we do not retain the original uploaded PDF on our primary systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Generated Content:</strong> If you use features that save outputs (e.g., when logged in), we <strong>do</strong> store the <em>generated content</em> (such as text summaries/reviews, downloadable overview PDFs created by the Service, generated audio files, extracted titles, references, etc.) associated with your user account.</li>
        <li><strong>Deletion of Generated Content Due to Inactivity:</strong> To manage resources effectively for this (currently free) service, we reserve the right to permanently delete stored <em>generated content</em> associated with your account if your account shows no activity (e.g., logging in, generating new content) for a continuous period of <strong>six (6) months</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> You are responsible for downloading and securely storing any generated content you wish to preserve long-term before potential deletion due to inactivity or service changes.</li>
        <li><strong>Exceptions:</strong> This policy does not override any legal obligations we may have to retain certain data (such as system logs or legally required account information) for specific periods as mandated by law.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Intellectual Property Rights</h2>
    <p>The Service and its original content (excluding User Content), features, functionality, look, and feel are and will remain the exclusive property of the Service operators and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws of both Denmark and foreign countries. Our trademarks and trade dress may not be used in connection with any product or service without our prior written consent. You are granted a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Service strictly in accordance with these Terms.</p>

    <h2>10. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ERROR-FREE, OR THAT THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE USE OF THE SERVICE WILL BE ACCURATE OR RELIABLE.</p>

    <h2>11. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL THE SERVICE OPERATORS, ITS AFFILIATES, AGENTS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, SUPPLIERS, OR LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE SERVICE. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE, LOSS, OR INJURY RESULTING FROM HACKING, TAMPERING, OR OTHER UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS OR USE OF THE SERVICE OR YOUR ACCOUNT OR THE INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN.</p>
    <p>OUR AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE SERVICE SHALL NOT EXCEED THE GREATER OF ONE HUNDRED DANISH KRONER (100 DKK) OR THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO US FOR THE PAST SIX MONTHS FOR THE SERVICE (IF ANY).</p>

    <h2>12. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms. We will endeavor to provide notice where reasonably practicable, particularly in cases of termination for inactivity or service discontinuation, but reserve the right to terminate immediately for cause (such as illegal activity or severe breaches).</p>
    <p>Upon termination, your right to use the Service will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your account, you may simply discontinue using the Service (note that generated content deletion follows the policy in Section 8). Provisions of these Terms that by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to the Service and Terms</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to modify or replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after those revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, please stop using the Service. We may also modify or discontinue the Service itself as described in Section 6.</p>

    <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of Denmark, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

    <h2>15. Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>Any dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms or the Service, including any disputes regarding the existence, validity, or termination thereof, shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by The Danish Institute of Arbitration in accordance with the rules of arbitration procedure adopted by The Danish Institute of Arbitration and in force at the time when such proceedings are commenced. The place of arbitration shall be Copenhagen, Denmark. The language of the arbitration shall be English unless otherwise agreed. Before initiating arbitration, we encourage you to contact us directly to seek a resolution.</p>

Please review our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> to understand our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information and your rights under applicable data protection laws (including GDPR).</p>

    <h2>17. Severability</h2>

    <h2>18. Entire Agreement</h2>
