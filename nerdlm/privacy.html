    <h1>Privacy Policy for PDF Digester</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: October 26, 2023</p> <!-- UPDATE THIS DATE -->

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how PDF Digester ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our service available at https://nerdlm.rjuro.com ("Service"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data transparently and securely.</p>
    <p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy and our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

    <h2>1. What Information We Collect and Why</h2>
    <p>We aim to collect only the information necessary to provide and improve the Service.</p>

    <h3>Information from Users Authenticating via Google:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When you choose to log in or create an account using Google Authentication, we receive basic profile information from Google, specifically your <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Email Address</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> We use this information to identify you within the Service, associate your generated content with your account, manage access, and communicate necessary Service-related information (e.g., policy updates, critical notices).</li>
        <li>We also collect and store <strong>Usage Data</strong> associated with your account, such as the number of documents or audio files generated, to manage service limits as outlined in our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Processed When You Upload Files:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>When you upload a PDF file for analysis, it is transferred securely via HTTPS to be processed.</li>
        <li><strong>Crucially, we do not permanently store your original uploaded PDF files on our servers.</strong> The files are processed transiently (temporarily held) to perform the requested analysis and summarization.</li>
        <li>This processing involves sending the content to third-party AI services (currently Google Gemini) as detailed in our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a> and Section 12 (Data Subprocessors) below. The handling of your data by these third parties is governed by their respective privacy policies.</li>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> This processing is essential to provide the core functionality of the Service â€“ digesting and summarizing your PDF content.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Generated Content You Choose to Store:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Service generates outputs like summaries, reviews, overview PDFs, and audio files ("Generated Content").</li>
        <li>If you are logged in, this Generated Content is stored and associated with your account (Name and Email Address) within our database (hosted on Supabase).</li>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> We store this Generated Content to allow you to access, review, and download it later via the "My Generations" tab.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. What Information We <strong>Do Not</strong> Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Browser Information:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> collect information typically gathered from website browsers, such as browser type, language preference, referring site, or detailed IP address logs for general tracking purposes. Basic server logs necessary for security and diagnostics may contain IP addresses but are not used for user behaviour analysis.</li>
        <li><strong>Tracking Across Websites:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> track your activity across other websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Sensitive Personal Information (Unless Uploaded):</strong> We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information (e.g., health data, financial details) unless you voluntarily include such information within the PDF documents you choose to upload for processing. Please be mindful of the content you upload.</li>
        <li><strong>Commercial Exploitation:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> share, sell, rent, or trade your Personal Information (Name, Email, Usage Data) or your Generated Content with third parties for their commercial purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Our Use of Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Necessary Cookies:</strong> The Service relies on Google Authentication and is built using Streamlit. These platforms may use essential cookies required for security, session management (keeping you logged in), and basic functionality. These are necessary for the Service to operate.</li>
        <li><strong>No Tracking Cookies:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> use cookies for cross-site tracking, behavioural advertising, or detailed analytics of your browsing habits on our site beyond basic operational needs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. How We Secure Your Information</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical Measures:</strong> We utilize Supabase for our backend infrastructure, hosted in Germany (EU). Supabase implements robust security measures. Data transmission (uploads, authentication) uses secure HTTPS protocols.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Access to user data within our system is restricted to authorized personnel for operational and support purposes only.</li>
        <li><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> We take all reasonable measures within our control to protect your information (Account Information and stored Generated Content) from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security. For highly sensitive information contained within PDFs, consider the risks inherent in uploading to any online service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Global Privacy Practices and Data Location</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Primary Storage:</strong> Your Account Information (Name, Email, Usage Data) and your stored Generated Content are stored and processed on Supabase servers located within the <strong>European Union (Germany)</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Processing:</strong> As mentioned, processing of uploaded PDF content involves third-party AI services (like Google Gemini) and TTS services (hosted on RunPod). These services may operate globally. We select providers committed to data privacy, but their specific processing locations are governed by their policies. Please refer to Section 12 (Data Subprocessors).</li>
    </ul>
