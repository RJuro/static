        <h1>Privacy Policy for PDF Digester</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: April 5, 2025</p> <!-- UPDATE THIS DATE AS NEEDED -->

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how PDF Digester ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our service available at https://nerdlm.rjuro.com ("Service"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data transparently and securely.</p>
        <p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy and our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a>.</p>

        <h2>1. What Information We Collect and Why</h2>
        <p>We aim to collect only the information necessary to provide and improve the Service.</p>

        <h3>Information from Users Authenticating via Google:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When you choose to log in or create an account using Google Authentication, we receive basic profile information from Google, specifically your <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Email Address</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Why:</strong> We use this information to identify you within the Service, associate your generated content with your account, manage access, and communicate necessary Service-related information (e.g., policy updates, critical notices).</li>
            <li>We also collect and store <strong>Usage Data</strong> associated with your account, such as the number of documents or audio files generated, to manage service limits as outlined in our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Information Processed When You Upload Files:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>When you upload a PDF file for analysis, it is transferred securely via HTTPS to be processed.</li>
            <li><strong>Crucially, we do not permanently store your original uploaded PDF files on our servers.</strong> The files are processed transiently (temporarily held) to perform the requested analysis and summarization.</li>
            <li>This processing involves sending the content to third-party AI services (currently Google Gemini) as detailed in our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a> and Section 12 (Data Subprocessors) below. The handling of your data by these third parties is governed by their respective privacy policies. <strong>Regardless of the specific data handling policies of our subprocessors, and following best practices recommended by providers like Google, you should not upload documents containing highly sensitive, confidential, or personal information that you are not comfortable transmitting to online services.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Why:</strong> This processing is essential to provide the core functionality of the Service â€“ digesting and summarizing your PDF content.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Generated Content You Choose to Store:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The Service generates outputs like summaries, reviews, overview PDFs, and audio files ("Generated Content").</li>
            <li>If you are logged in, this Generated Content is stored and associated with your account (Name and Email Address) within our database (hosted on Supabase).</li>
            <li><strong>Why:</strong> We store this Generated Content to allow you to access, review, and download it later via the "My Generations" tab.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>2. What Information We <strong>Do Not</strong> Collect</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Browser Information:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> collect information typically gathered from website browsers, such as browser type, language preference, referring site, or detailed IP address logs for general tracking purposes. Basic server logs necessary for security and diagnostics may contain IP addresses but are not used for user behaviour analysis.</li>
            <li><strong>Tracking Across Websites:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> track your activity across other websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Sensitive Personal Information (Unless Uploaded):</strong> We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information (e.g., health data, financial details) unless you voluntarily include such information within the PDF documents you choose to upload for processing. Please be mindful of the content you upload. <strong>As a general security and privacy measure, avoid uploading files containing highly sensitive personal, financial, or confidential information to the Service.</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Commercial Exploitation:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> share, sell, rent, or trade your Personal Information (Name, Email, Usage Data) or your Generated Content with third parties for their commercial purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Our Use of Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Necessary Cookies:</strong> The Service relies on Google Authentication and is built using Streamlit. These platforms may use essential cookies required for security, session management (keeping you logged in), and basic functionality. These are necessary for the Service to operate.</li>
            <li><strong>No Tracking Cookies:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> use cookies for cross-site tracking, behavioural advertising, or detailed analytics of your browsing habits on our site beyond basic operational needs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. How We Secure Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Technical Measures:</strong> We utilize Supabase for our backend infrastructure, hosted in Germany (EU). Supabase implements robust security measures. Data transmission (uploads, authentication) uses secure HTTPS protocols.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Control:</strong> Access to user data within our system is restricted to authorized personnel for operational and support purposes only.</li>
            <li><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> We take all reasonable measures within our control to protect your information (Account Information and stored Generated Content) from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee absolute security. For highly sensitive information contained within PDFs, consider the risks inherent in uploading to any online service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Global Privacy Practices and Data Location</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Storage:</strong> Your Account Information (Name, Email, Usage Data) and your stored Generated Content are stored and processed on Supabase servers located within the <strong>European Union (Germany)</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Third-Party Processing:</strong> As mentioned, processing of uploaded PDF content involves third-party AI services (like Google Gemini) and TTS services (hosted on RunPod). These services may operate globally. We select providers committed to data privacy, but their specific processing locations are governed by their policies. Please refer to Section 12 (Data Subprocessors).</li>
        </ul>

We will attempt to notify you about legal demands for your information when appropriate, unless prohibited by law or court order, or in emergency circumstances.</p>

        <h2>8. How You Can Access and Control Your Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Account Information (Name, Email):</strong> As we use Google Authentication, your primary profile information (Name, Email) is managed through your Google Account settings.</li>
            <li><strong>Generated Content:</strong> If you are a registered user, you can access your stored Generated Content via the "My Generations" tab within the Service. You have the ability to <strong>delete</strong> specific generated items directly from this interface at any time.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Deletion:</strong> If you wish to delete your PDF Digester account entirely (which includes removing your associated Name, Email, Usage Data, and all stored Generated Content from our active systems), please contact us using the method described in Section 6. We will process your request subject to the data retention policies outlined below.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>9. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Original Uploaded PDFs:</strong> As stated, we <strong>do not retain</strong> your original uploaded PDF files after processing.</li>
            <li><strong>Generated Content:</strong> We retain your stored Generated Content associated with your account as long as your account is active, or until you choose to delete specific items via the "My Generations" tab. Furthermore, as outlined in our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a>, we reserve the right to delete stored Generated Content associated with accounts that have been inactive for a continuous period of <strong>six (6) months</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> We retain your Account Information (Name, Email, Usage Data) for as long as your account remains active. If you request account deletion, we will delete this information from our active databases. However, some residual data may be retained in backups or logs for a limited period as necessary for legal compliance, security, or operational purposes before being permanently destroyed.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. How We Communicate With You</h2>
        <p>We will use the email address associated with your account (provided via Google Authentication) primarily for essential Service-related communications. This may include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Responding to your support requests or inquiries.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>We will <strong>not</strong> send you marketing emails unless you provide separate, explicit opt-in consent for such communications. You will always have the option to unsubscribe from any marketing emails.</p>

        <h2>11. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Website and updating the "Effective Date" at the top. For material changes, we aim to provide notice (e.g., via email or a notice within the Service) prior to the changes taking effect. Your continued use of the Service after the effective date constitutes your acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>12. Data Subprocessors</h2>
        <p>To provide the Service, we rely on certain third-party vendors ("Subprocessors") who may process your data on our behalf. Our key Subprocessors include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Google:</strong> For user authentication (Google Identity Platform / OAuth).</li>
            <li><strong>Google:</strong> For AI-powered content analysis and processing (Google Cloud AI Platform / Gemini Models). As PDF Digester operates within the European Union and utilizes a Google Cloud Billing account, Google processes the data submitted via the API under their <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms#data-use-paid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Paid Services" data usage terms</a> (which also apply to EU/EEA/CH/UK users regardless of billing status, as detailed in their full terms linked previously). According to these terms (as of the Effective Date of this policy), Google does not use your prompts or responses to improve their general models for these interactions and handles the data as a data processor. Please refer to Google's terms (<a href="https://ai.google.dev/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">main</a>, <a href="https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/terms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API specific</a>) for the most current and complete information.</li>
            <li><strong>Hetzner:</strong> For frontend app hosting and backend database hosting, storage of generated content and account information (Hosted in Germany, EU).</li>
            <li><strong>Google:</strong> Cloud Storage for short-term transfer storage of generated audio files (Hosted in Finland, EU).</li>
            <li><strong>RunPod:</strong> For hosting the infrastructure used by our text-to-speech (TTS) service (Hosted in Romania, EU).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We require our Subprocessors to adhere to strong data protection standards consistent with this policy and applicable laws like GDPR. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies and data usage terms of these subprocessors for further details. <strong>Even with these contractual safeguards, always exercise caution and avoid uploading highly sensitive or confidential information.</strong></p>
